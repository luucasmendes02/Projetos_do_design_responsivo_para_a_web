            <p>A server is a computer equipped with one or more processors, memory banks, communication ports, and occasionally some system for storing data such as internal hard disks or SSD memories. Capable of running a specific set of programs or protocols to provide services to other machines or clients, servers are equipment dedicated to running applications and services within a LAN or WAN network.</p>

            <p>To choose a server, you must be aware of the exact number and type of applications that will run, in addition to the number of users who will be connected. Large infrastructures often use the virtualization technique that has been increasingly adopted as a possible low-cost solution to meet basic information security requirements: Integrity, Confidentiality, and Availability.</p>

            <p>It is the perfect server type for small applications. The device has reduced cost, and dispenses with air-conditioned environment. In addition, it reduces the rate of intrusions by centralizing information in one place. <br> It can be used for web applications like Apache, ISS, Nginx. Supports database such as MYSQL, Postgres. Ideal for simultaneous use of up to 20 customers in midsize applications.</p>
